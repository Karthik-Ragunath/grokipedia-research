# DeepSeekMoE Architecture Illustration

[Figure: 
Illustration of DeepSeekMoE. 
Subfigure (a) showcases an MoE layer with the conventional top-2 routing strategy. 
Subfigure (b) illustrates the fine-grained expert segmentation strategy. 
Subsequently, subfigure (c) demonstrates the integration of the shared expert isolation strategy, constituting the complete DeepSeekMoE architecture.
It is noteworthy that across these three architectures, the number of expert parameters and computational costs remain constant.
