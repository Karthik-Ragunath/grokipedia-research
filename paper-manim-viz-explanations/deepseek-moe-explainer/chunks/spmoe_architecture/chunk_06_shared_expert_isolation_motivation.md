# Shared Expert Isolation Motivation

With a conventional routing strategy, tokens assigned to different experts may necessitate some common knowledge or information. 
As a result, multiple experts may converge in acquiring shared knowledge in their respective parameters, thereby resulting in redundancy in expert parameters. 
However, if there are shared experts dedicated to capturing and consolidating common knowledge across varying contexts, the parameter redundancy among other routed experts will be alleviated. 
This alleviation of redundancy will contribute to a more parameter-efficient model with more specialized experts.
