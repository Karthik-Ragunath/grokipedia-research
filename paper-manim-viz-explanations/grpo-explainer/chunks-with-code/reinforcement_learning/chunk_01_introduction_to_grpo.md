# Introduction to GRPO

## Group Relative Policy Optimization

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be effective in further improving the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs after the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage [wang2023math,wizardmath].
In this section, we introduce our efficient and effective RL algorithm, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

## Corresponding Code Implementation

**Relevance Score:** 8/10

**Explanation:** The paper chunk introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as an RL algorithm for improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs. The code sections show the core GRPO implementation in GRPOTrainer class, including initialization parameters, reward handling, and training configurations that directly correspond to the GRPO algorithm described in the paper.

### Code Section 1: Defines the GRPOTrainer class which implements the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, including proper citation to the DeepSeekMath paper where GRPO was introduced.

**File:** `grpo_trainer.py` (lines 116-238)

```python
class GRPOTrainer(BaseTrainer):
    """
    Trainer for the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method. This algorithm was initially proposed in the
    paper [DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language
    Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.03300).

    Example:

    ```python
    from datasets import load_dataset
    from trl import GRPOTrainer

    dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/tldr", split="train")


    def reward_func(completions, **kwargs):
        # Dummy reward function that rewards completions with more unique letters.
        return [float(len(set(completion))) for completion in completions]


    trainer = GRPOTrainer(
        model="Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct",
        reward_funcs=reward_func,
        train_dataset=dataset,
    )

    trainer.train()
    ```

    Args:
        model (`str | PreTrainedModel`):
            Model to be trained. Can be either:

            - A string, being the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co, or a
              path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
              [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `'./my_model_directory/'`. The model is loaded
              using [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`] with the keyword arguments in
              `args.model_init_kwargs`.
            - A [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`] object. Only causal language models are supported.
        reward_funcs (`RewardFunc | list[RewardFunc]`):
            Reward functions to be used for computing the rewards. To compute the rewards, we call all the reward
            functions with the prompts and completions and sum the rewards. Can be either:

            - A single reward function, such as:
                - A string: The *model ID* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co, or a
                path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `'./my_model_directory/'`. The model is loaded
                using [`~transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained`] with `num_labels=1` and the
                keyword arguments in `args.model_init_kwargs`.
                - A [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`] object: Only sequence classification models are supported.
                - A custom reward function: The function is provided with the prompts and the generated completions,
                  plus any additional columns in the dataset. It should return a list of rewards. Custom reward
                  functions can also return `None` when the reward is not applicable to those samples. This is useful
                  for multi-task training where different reward functions apply to different types of samples. When a
                  reward function returns `None` for a sample, that reward function is excluded from the reward
                  calculation for that sample. For more details, see [Using a custom reward
                  function](#using-a-custom-reward-function).

                  The trainer's state is also passed to the reward function. The trainer's state is an instance of
                  [`~transformers.TrainerState`] and can be accessed by accessing the `trainer_state` argument to the
                  reward function's signature.
            - A list of reward functions, where each item can independently be any of the above types. Mixing different
            types within the list (e.g., a string model ID and a custom reward function) is allowed.
        args ([`GRPOConfig`], *optional*):
            Configuration for this trainer. If `None`, a default configuration is used.
        train_dataset ([`~datasets.Dataset`] or [`~datasets.IterableDataset`]):
            Dataset to use for training. It must include a column `"prompt"`. Any additional columns in the dataset is
            ignored. The format of the samples can be either:

            - [Standard](dataset_formats#standard): Each sample contains plain text.
            - [Conversational](dataset_formats#conversational): Each sample contains structured messages (e.g., role
              and content).
        eval_dataset ([`~datasets.Dataset`], [`~datasets.IterableDataset`] or `dict[str, Dataset | IterableDataset]`):
            Dataset to use for evaluation. It must meet the same requirements as `train_dataset`.
        processing_class ([`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase`], [`~transformers.ProcessorMixin`], *optional*):
            Processing class used to process the data. The padding side must be set to "left". If `None`, the
            processing class is loaded from the model's name with [`~transformers.AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`]. A
            padding token, `tokenizer.pad_token`, must be set. If the processing class has not set a padding token,
            `tokenizer.eos_token` will be used as the default.
        reward_processing_classes ([`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase`] or `list[PreTrainedTokenizerBase]`, *optional*):
            Processing classes corresponding to the reward functions specified in `reward_funcs`. Can be either:

            - A single processing class: Used when `reward_funcs` contains only one reward function.
            - A list of processing classes: Must match the order and length of the reward functions in `reward_funcs`.
            If set to `None`, or if an element of the list corresponding to a [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`] is
            `None`, the tokenizer for the model is automatically loaded using
            [`~transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`]. For elements in `reward_funcs` that are custom reward
            functions (not [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`]), the corresponding entries in `reward_processing_classes`
            are ignored.
        callbacks (list of [`~transformers.TrainerCallback`], *optional*):
            List of callbacks to customize the training loop. Will add those to the list of default callbacks detailed
            in [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/callback).

            If you want to remove one of the default callbacks used, use the [`~transformers.Trainer.remove_callback`]
            method.
        optimizers (`tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR]`, *optional*, defaults to `(None, None)`):
            A tuple containing the optimizer and the scheduler to use. Will default to an instance of [`AdamW`] on your
            model and a scheduler given by [`get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`] controlled by `args`.
        peft_config ([`~peft.PeftConfig`], *optional*):
            PEFT configuration used to wrap the model. If `None`, the model is not wrapped.
        rollout_func (`RolloutFunc`, *optional*):
            Function to use for generating completions. It must take prompts, args, and processing_class as parameters
            and return a dict with `"prompt_ids"`, `"completion_ids"`, and `"logprobs"` fields. Any other fields that
            are forwarded to the reward functions. This feature is experimental and may change or be removed at any
            time without prior notice.

### Code Section 2: Defines the GRPOConfig class with specific parameters for GRPO training like beta (KL coefficient), num_iterations (μ), epsilon for clipping, importance sampling levels, and reward scaling strategies that are core to the GRPO algorithm.

**File:** `grpo_config.py` (lines 22-258)

```python
class GRPOConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    Configuration class for the [`GRPOTrainer`].

    This class includes only the parameters that are specific to GRPO training. For a full list of training arguments,
    please refer to the [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`] documentation. Note that default values in this class may
    differ from those in [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`].

    Using [`~transformers.HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        > Parameters that control the model and reference model

        model_init_kwargs (`str`, `dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Keyword arguments for [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`], used when the `model`
            argument of the [`GRPOTrainer`] is provided as a string.
        disable_dropout (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to disable dropout in the model. This is useful for training with a reference model, as it prevents
            the model from generating different logprobs for the same input.
        cast_lm_head_to_fp32 (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to cast the language modeling head of the policy and reference models to float32. As recommended by
            the [ScaleRL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.13786) recipe. This flag is only supported when the model
            has untied word embedding and language modeling head layers i.e. `tie_word_embeddings` in the model config
            is False.

        > Parameters that control the data preprocessing
        remove_unused_columns (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to only keep the column `"prompt"` in the dataset. If you use a custom reward function that
            requires any column other than `"prompts"` and `"completions"`, you should keep this to `False`.
        max_prompt_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `512`):
            Maximum length of the prompt. If the prompt is longer than this value, it will be truncated left.
        num_generations (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `8`):
            Number of generations per prompt to sample. The effective batch size (num_processes * per_device_batch_size
            * gradient_accumulation_steps) must be evenly divisible by this value.
        max_completion_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `256`):
            Maximum length of the generated completion.
        ds3_gather_for_generation (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            This setting applies to DeepSpeed ZeRO-3. If enabled, the policy model weights are gathered for generation,
            improving generation speed. However, disabling this option allows training models that exceed the VRAM
            capacity of a single GPU, albeit at the cost of slower generation. Disabling this option is not compatible
            with vLLM generation.
        shuffle_dataset (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to shuffle the training dataset.

        > Parameters that control generation

        generation_batch_size: (`int`, *optional*):
            Batch size to use for generation. If `None`, it defaults to the effective training batch size:
            `per_device_train_batch_size * num_processes * steps_per_generation`. In other words, there is one
            generation batch processed per optimization step. Mutually exclusive with `steps_per_generation`.
        steps_per_generation: (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of steps per generation. If `None`, it defaults to `gradient_accumulation_steps`. Mutually exclusive
            with `generation_batch_size`.
        temperature (`float`, defaults to `1.0`):
            Temperature for sampling. The higher the temperature, the more random the completions.
        top_p (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1.0`):
            Float that controls the cumulative probability of the top tokens to consider. Must be in (0, 1]. Set to
            `1.0` to consider all tokens.
        top_k (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. If `None`, top-k-filtering is
            disabled and all tokens are considered.
        min_p (`float`, *optional*):
            Minimum token probability, which will be scaled by the probability of the most likely token. It must be a
            value between `0.0` and `1.0`. Typical values are in the `0.01-0.2` range.
        generation_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Additional keyword arguments to pass to [`~transformers.GenerationConfig`] (if using transformers) or
            `SamplingParams` (if using vLLM) when sampling completions. This can be used to further customize the
            generation behavior, such as setting `suppress_tokens`, `num_beams`, etc. If it contains keys that conflict
            with the other generation parameters (like `min_p`, `top_p`, etc.), they will override them.
        chat_template_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Additional keyword arguments to pass to the `apply_chat_template` function when generating completions.
        repetition_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1.0`):
            Float that penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the prompt and the generated text so far.
            Values > `1.0` encourage the model to use new tokens, while values < `1.0` encourage the model to repeat
            tokens.
        use_transformers_paged (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use the `transformers` paged implementation for generation. If set to `True`, the `transformers`
            paged implementation will be used for generation instead of the default padded implementation. This
            parameter is only effective when `use_vllm` is set to `False`.
        cache_implementation (`str`, *optional*):
            Implementation of the cache method for faster generation when `use_vllm` is set to `False`.

        > Parameters that control generation acceleration powered by vLLM

        use_vllm (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use vLLM for generating completions. If set to `True`, the trainer will use vLLM for generation
            instead of the default model.generate(). Requires `vllm` to be installed.
        vllm_mode (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"server"`):
            Mode to use for vLLM integration when `use_vllm` is set to `True`. Must be one of `"server"` or
            `"colocate"`.

            - `"server"`: The trainer will send generation requests to a separate vLLM server. Make sure a TRL vLLM
              server is running (start with `trl vllm-serve`).
            - `"colocate"`: vLLM will run in the same process and share the training GPUs. This avoids the need for a
              separate server but may cause resource contention with training.
        vllm_model_impl (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"vllm"`):
            Model implementation to use for vLLM. Must be one of `"transformers"` or `"vllm"`. `"transformers"`: Use
            the `transformers` backend for model implementation. `"vllm"`: Use the `vllm` library for model
            implementation.
        vllm_guided_decoding_regex (`str`, *optional*):
            Regex for vLLM guided decoding. If `None` (default), guided decoding is disabled.

        > Parameters that control the vLLM server (only used when `vllm_mode` is `"server"`)

        vllm_server_base_url (`str`, *optional*):
            Base URL for the vLLM server (e.g., `"http://localhost:8000"`). If provided, `vllm_server_host` and
            `vllm_server_port` are ignored.
        vllm_server_host (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"0.0.0.0"`):
            Host of the vLLM server to connect to. Ignored if `vllm_server_base_url` is provided.
        vllm_server_port (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `8000`):
            Port of the vLLM server to connect to. Ignored if `vllm_server_base_url` is provided.
        vllm_server_timeout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `240.0`):
            Total timeout duration in seconds to wait for the vLLM server to be up. If the server is not up after the
            timeout, a `ConnectionError` is raised.

        > Parameters that control colocated vLLM execution (only used when `vllm_mode` is `"colocate"`)

        vllm_gpu_memory_utilization (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.3`):
            Control the GPU memory utilization for vLLM. This setting only applies when `vllm_mode` is set to
            `"colocate"`. If you are using `vllm_mode="server"`, this parameter must be passed separately when
            launching the vLLM server via the `--vllm_gpu_memory_utilization` flag.
        vllm_tensor_parallel_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Control the tensor parallel size for vLLM. This setting only applies when `vllm_mode` is set to
            `"colocate"`. If you are using `vllm_mode="server"`, this parameter must be passed separately when
            launching the vLLM server via the `--vllm_tensor_parallel_size` flag.
        vllm_enable_sleep_mode (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to enable sleep mode for vLLM. If `True`, vLLM will sleep during the optimization step and woken
            for weight sync and generation.

        > Parameters that control the training

        beta (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.0`):
            KL coefficient. If `0.0` (default), the reference model is not loaded, reducing memory usage and improving
            training speed.
        num_iterations (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Number of iterations per batch (denoted as μ in the algorithm).
        epsilon (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.2`):
            Epsilon value for clipping.
        delta (`float`, *optional*):
            Enables the upper clipping bound in two-sided GRPO loss when set to a float. If `None` (default), standard
            GRPO clipping is used. Recommended to be greater than `1 + ε` when enabled. This method is introduced in
            the [INTELLECT-2 tech report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07291).
        epsilon_high (`float`, *optional*):
            Upper-bound epsilon value for clipping. If not specified, it defaults to the same value as the lower-bound
            specified in argument `epsilon`. Paper [DAPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476) recommends `0.28`.
        importance_sampling_level (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"token"`):
            Controls whether importance sampling ratios are computed at the `"token"` or `"sequence"` level. `"token"`
            keeps the raw per-token log-probability ratios (one weight per token). `"sequence"` averages the
            log-probability ratios across valid tokens to produce a single ratio per sequence. The [GSPO
            paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18071) shows that sequence-level sampling often yields more
            stable training and better alignment with sequence-level rewards.
        reward_weights (`list[float]`, *optional*):
            Weights for each reward function. Must match the number of reward functions. If `None`, all rewards are
            weighted equally with weight `1.0`.
        scale_rewards (`str` or `bool`, *optional*, defaults to `"group"`):
            Specifies the scaling strategy for rewards. Supported values are:

            - `True` or `"group"` (default): rewards are scaled by the standard deviation within each group, ensuring
              unit variance within a group.
            - `"batch"`: rewards are scaled by the standard deviation across the entire batch, as recommended in the
              [PPO Lite paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.08221).
            - `False` or `"none"`: no scaling is applied. The [Dr. GRPO
              paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20783) recommends not scaling rewards, as scaling by the
              standard deviation introduces a question-level difficulty bias.
        loss_type (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"dapo"`):
            Specifies the loss formulation to use. Supported values are:

            - `"grpo"`: Aggregates token-level losses by normalizing over sequence length. Not recommended due to
              length bias—this approach tends to prefer shorter completions with positive advantages and longer ones
              with negative advantages.
            - `"dr_grpo"`: Aggregates token-level losses by normalizing with a global constant. This method was
              introduced in the [Dr. GRPO paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20783) to eliminate length bias.
              The value of the constant corresponds to `max_completion_length`.
            - `"dapo"` (default): Aggregates token-level losses by normalizing with the number of active token in the
              global accumulated batch. This method was introduced in the [DAPO
              paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476) to eliminate length bias.
            - `"bnpo"`: Aggregates token-level losses by normalizing with the number of active token in the local
              batch. Note that normalization is performed over the local batch only, so results may slightly vary
              depending on the local batch size, despite a constant effective batch size. When using
              `per_device_train_batch_size==1`, the loss is equivalent to the GRPO loss.
        mask_truncated_completions (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            When enabled, truncated completions are excluded from the loss calculation, preventing them from being
            incorrectly penalized and introducing noise during training. According to the
            [DAPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476) paper, this is a good practice for training stability.
        sync_ref_model (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to synchronize the reference model with the active model every `ref_model_sync_steps` steps, using
            the `ref_model_mixup_alpha` parameter. This synchronization originates from the
            [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper.
        ref_model_mixup_alpha (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.6`):
            α parameter from the [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper, which controls the mix
            between the current policy and the previous reference policy during updates. The reference policy is
            updated according to the equation: `π_ref = α * π_θ + (1 - α) * π_ref_prev`. To use this parameter, you
            must set `sync_ref_model=True`.
        ref_model_sync_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `512`):
            τ parameter from the [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper, which determines how
            frequently the current policy is synchronized with the reference policy. To use this parameter, you must
            set `sync_ref_model=True`.
        top_entropy_quantile (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1.0`):
            ρ parameter from [Beyond the 80/20 Rule](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.01939). Keeps in the policy
            loss term only the top-ρ quantile of tokens by entropy of the probability distribution at each sequence
            position, improving results. Range: `[0.0-1.0]`. A value of `0.0` masks all but the highest entropy token;
            `1.0` keeps all tokens. The paper recommends a value of `0.2`. If used with
            `mask_truncated_completions=True`, only tokens from non-truncated completions are considered.
        use_liger_loss (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to use Liger loss.

            <Deprecated version="0.25.0">

            Parameter `use_liger_loss` is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.28.0. Use `use_liger_kernel`
            instead.

            </Deprecated>

        vllm_importance_sampling_correction (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to apply Truncated Importance Sampling (TIS) between vLLM completion logprobs and recomputed
            logprobs. [Your Efficient RL Framework Secretly Brings You Off-Policy RL
            Training](https://fengyao.notion.site/off-policy-rl) highlights that using a separate generation framework
            (such as vLLM) can introduce off-policy effects due to subtle implementation differences between generation
            and training backends. TIS is proposed as a remedy for this issue.
        vllm_importance_sampling_cap (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `2.0`):
            Truncation parameter C for Truncated Importance Sampling (TIS). This sets an upper bound on the importance
            sampling ratio, improving training stability.

        > Parameters that control the logging

        log_completions (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to log a sample of (prompt, completion) pairs every `logging_steps` steps. If `rich` is installed,
            it prints the sample. If `wandb` and/or `trackio` logging is enabled, it logs it to `wandb` and/or
            `trackio`.
        num_completions_to_print (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of completions to print with `rich`. If `None`, all completions are logged.
        wandb_log_unique_prompts (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to log unique prompts in wandb. If `True`, only unique prompts are logged. If `False`, all prompts
            are logged.
