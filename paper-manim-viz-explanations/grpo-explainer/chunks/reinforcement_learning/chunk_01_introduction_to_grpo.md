# Introduction to GRPO

## Group Relative Policy Optimization

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be effective in further improving the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs after the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage [wang2023math,wizardmath].
In this section, we introduce our efficient and effective RL algorithm, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
